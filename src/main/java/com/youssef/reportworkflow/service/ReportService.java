/*
 DESIGN NOTE: TEMPORARY FAKE STATE UPDATE IN API RESPONSE for `reviewReport()` and `validateOrRefuseReport()` methods

&& Context:
- The actual report state update is **event-driven** and happens asynchronously via `ReportStateEventListener`.
- However, because the event runs in a separate thread, **the returned report might still show the old state** when this method completes.
- To prevent confusion, we **manually update the returned DTO** to show the expected state immediately.

&& Why This Works for Our Use Case:
- Reviewing a report is not an instant-impact action** like a transaction or booking.
- Multiple actors are involved (Owner, Reviewer, Validator)**, and they interact over time.
- If the user fetches the report later, they will get the correct state from the database.**

&& Why Not Make It Fully Synchronous?
1- Blocking Approach (Not Used)**
   - We could force `workflowService.reviewReport()` to wait until the event completes.
   - This would slow down the API and defeat the purpose of an **event-driven system**.

2- Async Without Faking the Update (Not Used for Now)
   - The API would return the old state, which might confuse users.
   - Users expect to see "REVIEWED" right after calling this API.

3- Future Improvements (Hybrid approach)
    - Don't fake the data, use a SSE to notify clients when the update completes.

I personally prefer the SSE approach, but I think we have to know our exact needs, since we don't even have a UI client
yet, but if I were to choose, I would go with the SSE approach. and make and endpoint to which the client suscribe and return the
updated report as soon as the event is processed.
I personally prefer the SSE approach, but before implementing it, we should define our exact needs.
Since we donâ€™t have a UI client yet, and this isn't a real world project, it might not be necessary right now.
However, if I had to implement it, I think the best way to handle this would be to provide
an endpoint where clients can subscribe and receive the updated report as soon as the event is processed.


Todo: Discuss this with Mohamed or implement the hybrid approach later.
